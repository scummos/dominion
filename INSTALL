A program which plays Dominion. See README for documentation on its usage.

Installation
============

Requires a C++20-capable compiler and version 3.14+ of the CMake build system.
To build the graphical user interface, requires a recent version of Qt (written for 5.14, older versions might work but untested),
the KF5::SyntaxHighlighting framework, and the Qwt (Qt Widgets for Technical Applications) libraries version 6+.

To build:
# mkdir build
# cd build
# cmake ..
# make -j 4

Usage
=====

To run the GUI application, start
# ./dominion_qt

To run the CLI application, provide it with two strategy files (.buylist):
# ./dominion_cli ../strategies/witch.buylist ../strategies/bm.buylist
 Reading file ../strategies/witch.buylist
 Reading file ../strategies/bm.buylist
 Player 1 wins 23258 out of 25000 games, 427 draws
 (winrate 93.032% vs 5.26%)

The result is at best moderately useful, if you want to use the CLI application, you
most likely want to customize what it does by modifying main.cpp. It can produce various statistics,
some examples are shown there.
